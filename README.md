# Banana
Banana is a simple project made few years ago for a universitary exam. It's a platform 2d game with game editor that uses HTML5 canvas with javascript API. No additional frameworks are used.

## The goal
The goal is to take all the stars, that's all folks! You can find [here](http://onlybananas.altervista.org/bananagame/) a playable version of this game. It works on chrome only.

## Notes
The most of graphics and all the sounds used in this game are not of my property. Unfortunately I don't remember where I took them and therefore I'm not able to credit anyone. The "banana guy" sprites are made by my friend, please don't use without permissions.
